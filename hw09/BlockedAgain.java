First, add the method getInt(), which, when called in the main method, will request input from the user 
and solve [problem A] by calling methods checkInt() and checkRange().  
getInt() continues to request input from the user until acceptable input is provided.  
Next, add the method checkint(), which, when called by getInt(), will accept inputs of your choice 
and test whether the userâ€™s input is an integer (hint: use a scanner method), solving [problem A1].  
Finally, implement the method checkRange(), which, when called by getInt(), will accept inputs of your choice 
and test whether the userâ€™s input is within range 1-9 inclusive, solving [problem A2]. 
We suggest checkInt() return boolean and checkRange return type int.
Now that acceptable input has been gathered, it is time to solve [problem B] and its subproblems.  
First, implement the method allBlocks(int x), which, as seen in the main method, will accept the integer generated 
by getInt() and solve [problem B] by calling a method called block().  
Next, implement the method block(), which, when called in allBlocks(), will accept input variables of your choice 
and solve [problem B1] by calling a method called line().  Finally, implement the method line(), which will 
accept input variables of your choice from block() and solve [problem B1a].
